$ V = (dif x)/(dif t) $<eq:velocity>

As seen in @eq:velocity, the differential of distance over the differential of time which equals velocity.

$ V &= (dif x)/(dif t) #<eq:velocity-1>\
V &= integral f(x) dif t #<eq:velocity-alt> $ <eq:vel-comparison>

@eq:velocity-1 is equal to @eq:velocity-alt as seen in @eq:vel-comparison.
